These data provide areas designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary care, dental care, or mental health providers. HRSAâ€™s Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) develops shortage designation criteria and uses them to decide whether or not a geographic area or population group is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP). More than 34 federal programs depend on HPSA/MUA/MUP designations to determine eligibility or as a funding preference. About 20 percent of the U.S. population resides in primary medical care HPSAs. HPSAs may have shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers; may be urban or rural areas; population groups; or medical or other public facilities.
