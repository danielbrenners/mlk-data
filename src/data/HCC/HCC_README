This dataset provides a list of federally-funded health centers that provide health services. For more than 40 years, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-supported health centers have provided comprehensive, culturally competent, quality primary health care services to medically underserved communities and vulnerable populations. Health centers are community-based and consumer-run organizations that serve populations with limited access to health care. These include low-income populations, the uninsured, those with limited English proficiency, migratory and seasonal agricultural workers, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and those living in public housing.
